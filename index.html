  <p>I have researched Messi and Ronaldos statistics from the 2009-10 season up until 2017-18 season, here is what i found out:".</p>
<ul>
    <li>Messi's Best Liga Season: 50 goals in 2011-12. Basically, he was a human goal machine that year.</li>
    <li>Ronaldo's Best Liga Season: 48 goals in 2014-15. Ronaldo wasn’t slacking either – nearly as many as Messi!</li>
    <li>Messi’s Best CL Goals: 14 in 2011-12. Europe was his playground that season.</li>
    <li>Ronaldo’s Best CL Goals: 17 in 2013-14. Cristiano was the top scorer in Europe that year.</li>
    <li>Messi’s Most Assists: 21 in 2010-11. Not just scoring, but setting up goals like a true playmaker.</li>
    <li>Ronaldo’s Most Assists: 16 in 2015-16. A multitasker – scoring and assisting like a pro.</li>
</ul>
